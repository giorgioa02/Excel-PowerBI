= VALUE1 & IF(VALUE2<>"", ", " & VALUE2, "") & ", " & VALUE3
# This formula concatenates values from three different cells (VALUE1, VALUE2, and VALUE 3) into a single string, with conditional formatting:

= COUNTA(SheetName!Column:Column) - 1
# This formula counts the number of non-empty cells in a specified column and subtracts one from the result. Useful for determining the number of entries in a dataset, excluding the header.

=COUNTIF(SheetName1!Column1:Column1, 100%)
=COUNTIF(SheetName2!Column2:Column2, 0)
# These formulas count the number of cells in aspecified columns that meet certain criteria. Useful for quickly identifying the frequency of specified values within a dataset.
